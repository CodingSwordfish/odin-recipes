    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that features layers of flat pasta sheets, savory meat sauce (ragù), creamy béchamel sauce, and rich cheeses like mozzarella and parmesan. This hearty dish is baked in the oven until the cheese melts and bubbles, creating a delicious and visually appealing casserole.

        Lasagna variations are plentiful, but the traditional recipe involves layering cooked lasagna noodles with a meat sauce made from ground beef, pork, or sausage, simmered with tomatoes, herbs, and spices. Béchamel sauce, a creamy white sauce made with butter, flour, and milk, adds another layer of flavor and texture. The lasagna is then generously topped with grated cheeses, which melt and become golden brown during baking.
        
        Lasagna is a perfect dish for feeding a crowd and can be enjoyed hot or cold. It's a celebratory meal that's sure to please everyone at the table.</p>
