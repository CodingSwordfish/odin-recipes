    <h1>Recipe for Lasagna</h1>
    <img src="../images/lasagna.webp" alt="lasagna">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that features layers of flat pasta sheets, savory meat sauce (ragù), creamy béchamel sauce, and rich cheeses like mozzarella and parmesan. This hearty dish is baked in the oven until the cheese melts and bubbles, creating a delicious and visually appealing casserole.

        Lasagna variations are plentiful, but the traditional recipe involves layering cooked lasagna noodles with a meat sauce made from ground beef, pork, or sausage, simmered with tomatoes, herbs, and spices. Béchamel sauce, a creamy white sauce made with butter, flour, and milk, adds another layer of flavor and texture. The lasagna is then generously topped with grated cheeses, which melt and become golden brown during baking.
        
        Lasagna is a perfect dish for feeding a crowd and can be enjoyed hot or cold. It's a celebratory meal that's sure to please everyone at the table.</p>

            <li>Lasagna noodles (enough for desired layers)</li>
            <li>Ground beef, pork, or Italian sausage (optional, for meat sauce)</li>
            <li>Crushed tomatoes or tomato puree</li>
            <li>Diced onion and garlic</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Dried herbs (basil, oregano, thyme)</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Grated mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>Grated parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Prepare the Meat Sauce (optional): If using meat sauce, brown the ground meat in a large pan with olive oil. Drain any excess fat. Add diced onion and garlic, cook until softened. Stir in crushed tomatoes, herbs, and seasonings. Simmer for at least 30 minutes to allow flavors to meld.</li>
            <li> Cook the Lasagna Noodles: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add lasagna noodles and cook according to package instructions until al dente (slightly firm to the bite). Drain and rinse with cool water to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li> Make the Béchamel Sauce (White Sauce): In a saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Whisk in flour and cook for 1 minute. Slowly whisk in milk, a little at a time, until the sauce thickens and becomes smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li> Assemble the Lasagna: Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of meat sauce (if using) on the bottom. Top with a layer of cooked lasagna noodles. Spread a layer of béchamel sauce over the noodles, followed by a sprinkling of mozzarella and parmesan cheese. Repeat these layers, ending with a cheese topping.</li>
            <li> Bake the Lasagna: Cover the baking dish with foil and bake for 30 minutes. Remove foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the cheese is golden brown and bubbly. Let the lasagna cool slightly before serving.</li>
